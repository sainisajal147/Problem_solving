hello and good afternoon sir, im sajal saini, currently im in my final year b.tech in IIT bhilai as a mechincal engineering graduate, over the years ive developed a huge interest in the field of programming and software, I use cpp and python as my primary programming language, ive worked on a web development project(viz a placement preparation portal for a students) and a data science project(viz an acciedent severity predictor viz based on a lagre accident dataset), furthermore i have strong communication and presentation skills, i have interset in DS algo, Competitive programming, Web development and data science.

the most important part of the data analysis is data visualization and data understanding, uderstanding the patterns of the data that would eventluy help us to make decission besd on that data,

of all the thing i tried implementing the programming like web development, CFD, data sience is what interest me more because i feel like this is what is close to the real life problem solving,

data analysis interest me more, i have strong problemsolving skills and im good with numbers and data, and that would help me grow and can be the beificial extension to the firm.
